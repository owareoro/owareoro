### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is my student github account. The real fun usually happens [here](https://github.com/rowend36) instead.
But if some reason, you are still reading this,.....

Nice to meet you.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on lots of stuff. You should really check [this](https://github.com/rowend36) out.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning iOS software development. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about anything related to software. But beware, I do not give one word answers.
- âš¡ Fun Fact: This account was created to **appease** the gods of **ALX Software Engineering** with an account bearing my **real name** rather than some **meaningless name** I used until I became **less suspicious** of the internet. Everything is seriously **better** at my [older profile](https://github.com/rowend36).
